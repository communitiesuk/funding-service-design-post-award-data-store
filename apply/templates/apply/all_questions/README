# All Questions folder
This folder contains templates for the round specific all questions html pages.

The structure has had to change now the all questions page is generated by a [script](https://dluhcdigital.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FS/pages/45580513/Generating+the+All+Questions+page+and+Assessment+Field+Display+info) as we now generate separate pages for each language.

## uses_translations - DEPRECATED
Historically, to accomodate welsh versions of the all questions page, we have had one page that used babel to grab translations at rendering time. This folder contains the all questions pages for COF R2 and R3 that were done in this style.

It is not expected that any further pages will be added to this folder.
