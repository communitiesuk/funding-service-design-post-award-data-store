,,"Guidance Notes:
Please report your measurements against the mandatory, project-specific and custom output indicators for each project using the tables below. Please input both actual outputs and forecasted outputs (see row 22 which helps to differentiate this per reporting period).

There are two sections. Section A is confirmation that you are happy with the information provided in Section B. Section B allows for information to be recorded for up to twenty projects. For each project, the actions required are:

1. Check the project name to confirm what outputs you should be entering in each table.
2. Fill in ALL information for the three, pre-populated mandatory indicators (highlighted blue) at the top of the table.
3. Below the three mandatory indicators, there is space to select project-specific output indicators from our standard set, using the drop-down list provided. You should select these based on the specifics of the project.
4. Finally, if there are any additional output indicators that are not included in our standard set of indicators, but you intend to report against (e.g. for your local evaluation), then please use the custom indicators section to do this.
5. Please repeat steps 1 to 4 for each additional project.

Important Notes
a. For each column in the tables, please report the change in outputs observed during that period. For example, if 10 new jobs have been created in H1, then enter 10 for that period. Subsequently, if no new jobs are created in H2 then enter 0 for that period (i.e., we do not want the cumulative values). This means that, particularly for the employment indicators, you may need to enter negative numbers for some periods.
b. When inputting figures for output indicators, ensure no boxes are left uncompleted. Please complete the box by entering a 0 (zero) if there are no outputs recorded or forecast. If the row is greyed out, there is no need to enter 0 figures.
